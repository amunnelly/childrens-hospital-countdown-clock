            <header><h3>The Story So Far:</h3></header>
            <p>
                <b>June 30th, 2025</b>, is the long looked-forward to date when
                Ireland's National Children's Hospital will finally open its
                doors for business.
            </p>
            <p>
                We know this because the Minister for Health, Mr Stephen
                Donnelly, TD, was interviewed on
                <a href="https://www.rte.ie/radio/radio1/this-week/">This Week on RTÉ Radio 1</a>
                on Sunday, October 6th, 2024, and said so. Minister Donnelly
                said that BAM, the building company involved in building the
                hospital, had committed to a deadline of June 30th, 2025.
            </p>
            <p>
                While the Minister named the date he didn't also mention the
                time. In the spirits of sportsmanship, benefit of the doubt
                and what used to be called during Covid-Times "an abundance
                of caution," we're willing to cut the poor sap a break and
                give him until one second to midnight before the clock runs
                out, again, on the monument to folly and incompetence at 31
                James's Walk, Rialto, Dublin 8, D08 E191.
            </p>
            <p>
                Will the Hospital doors swing open on deadline, or will the
                nation be treated to more of the same?

                            National children’s hospital: Construction firm BAM
                            commits to June completion date

                            Building firm BAM has committed to a completion date of June of next year for the new
                            national children’s hospital in Dublin, Minister for Health, Stephen Donnelly, has said.

                            The hospital was initially scheduled to be completed in 2020 with a budget of €650 million.
                            Four years later the final bill is expected to be in the region of €2.2 billion.

                            In an interview with RTÉ on Sunday, Mr Donnelly confirmed he had met senior executives from
                            BAM last week.

                            Fear National Children’s Hospital €2.2 Billion Cost Could Increase Again

                            The new National Children’s Hospital’s €2.2 billion price tag might grow even further, a
                            member of the Oireachtas Health Committee has warned.

                            The Chief Executive of the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board will appear before
                            the committee today and outline why construction company BAM has moved its completion date
                            14 times in the past four years.

                            David Gunning will also tell the committee the approach being taken by BAM shows complete
                            disregard for sick children, young people and their families.

                            The new National Paediatric Hospital will be a world-class facility and mostly all-digital,
                            with very little paper.

                            It will also serve the children of Ireland and support their parents for about 100 years.

                            But it will also remain long in the memory as a by-word for how a national public project
                            should never be managed.

                            It will likely hold the unenviable record as the most expensive children’s hospital in the
                            world and have taken around two decades to build and open.

                            It could be February next year before the new National Children’s Hospital is complete, the
                            Public Accounts Committee (PAC) was told today.
                            The delay follows confirmation that the most recent timeline of October 29 for finishing the
                            €2.2bn hospital would not be met.

                            David Gunning of the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board told the committee that
                            the contractors BAM, in its most recent monthly update, said the new completion date was
                            2025.

                            He said the board has directed the contractor to provide an updated progress report and it
                            is yet to receive it. <p>
